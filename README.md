### About
Thank you for downloading StockSim version 1.0 (Public Release)!!!  
This program was programmed in ICE, a revolutionary programming language created  
and developed by PT_ (or P_T on IRC). Although primarily programed by LAX18, special thanks to  
PT_ for help with optimization of the program (i.e teaching me lists exsist in ICE :P) and   
SM84CE and beckadamtheinventor, for help with the saving and loading to an appvar (along with PT_).

StockSim is a game originally coded on the Nintendo 3DS via SmileBASIC for CC21. After getting  
various requests (and wanting to do this myself), I ported this to ICE for the TI84+CE. StockSim itself is  
a simulation game based on the American stock market. Players can buy and sell stocks, while monitoring  several  
charts. Players have to determine the best times to sell, whilst monitoring best times to buy other stocks. Players  
can select from EASY and HARD modes and can save/continue their games.
